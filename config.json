The nodes are separated by communities, and further grouped by date and address information if included in the entry.  \n\nThis visualization can serve as a tool for pinpointing trends in the coverage of certain communities, as well as identify potential gaps in digitized material. \n\nIt is my hope that the visualization will be significantly more populated by the end of my work on this project and that future network visualizations can help illuminate new connections within the repository and uncover a more diverse and representative cultural history.
